## Title: Advanced IMDB Movie Rating Analysis

This repository contains an advanced data visualization project using Python with the IMDB Movie Dataset. The IMDB dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning and data analysis, and in this project, I've taken it a step further by implementing advanced visualization techniques to gain deeper insights.

### A. Dataset Description: 
The dataset is available in several snapshots. The ones that were used in this analysis were Latest Datasets - both full and small (for web scraping). They were last updated in October 2016.

We will be using the following dataset:

      Movie-Rating.csv

### B. Advanced Visualization Techniques:
In this project, I've applied advanced data visualization techniques such as:

      1. LMplot with color-coded data points based on the 'Genre' column in the DataFrame.
      2. Two subplots arranged in a single row and two columns - kdeplot function to visualize the distribution of data in the DataFrame.
      3. Box plot providing information about the median, quartiles, and potential outliers in the 'AudienceRating' for each genre.
      4. Grid of scatter plots, each depicting the relationship between 'CriticRating' and 'AudienceRating' for a specific combination of genre and year.
      5. Variety of plots to visualize different aspects of the data such as KDE plots, violin plots, and box plots.
